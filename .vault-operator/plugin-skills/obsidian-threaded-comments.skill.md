# Threaded Comments

**Description:** Notion-style threaded comments for Obsidian notes.
**Status:** Enabled
**Plugin ID:** obsidian-threaded-comments

## Setup Required

No settings file found (data.json). Plugin may need initial setup via Obsidian Settings.
Guide the user to configure this plugin via Obsidian Settings if needed.

## Available Commands

Available command IDs (use execute_command for Obsidian-native commands):
- `obsidian-threaded-comments:toggle-comments-sidebar` -- Threaded Comments: Toggle comments sidebar
- `obsidian-threaded-comments:insert-comment` -- Threaded Comments: Insert comment

## Configuration File

Settings path: `.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-threaded-comments/data.json`

To configure this plugin programmatically:
1. Read the config: read_file(".obsidian/plugins/obsidian-threaded-comments/data.json")
2. Understand the settings structure and modify values as needed
3. Write changes: write_file(".obsidian/plugins/obsidian-threaded-comments/data.json", updatedJSON)

Do NOT ask the user to open Settings UI. Modify data.json directly.

## Documentation

For detailed plugin documentation (commands, options, dependencies):
read_file(".vault-operator/plugin-skills/obsidian-threaded-comments.readme.md")

## Usage

When the user asks for functionality related to Threaded Comments:
1. Read the plugin documentation (.readme.md) to understand capabilities and dependencies
2. Read the config file (.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-threaded-comments/data.json). If it does not exist, that is normal -- create it with the required settings
3. Configure the plugin by writing data.json with the values needed for the task
4. Execute the task using the appropriate tool:
   - For Obsidian-native commands (including file export): use execute_command
   - For CLI-based conversion needing Pandoc/LaTeX: use execute_recipe
   - For data queries: use call_plugin_api
5. If a command opens a UI dialog, tell the user what to click.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Prefer native Obsidian commands over external tools when both can accomplish the task.
- NEVER create fake output files. If the user asks for a PDF/DOCX/image export, use execute_recipe -- do NOT write content to a .pdf file yourself.
- If a dependency is missing (e.g. Pandoc), tell the user what to install.
IMPORTANT: After reading this file, ALWAYS take action or respond. Never end silently.
