Plugin "Workspace" provides core Obsidian workspace operations.

Available commands:
- workspace:export-pdf -- Export the currently open note to PDF using Obsidian's built-in renderer
- workspace:close -- Close the currently active tab
- workspace:split-horizontal -- Split the current pane horizontally
- workspace:split-vertical -- Split the current pane vertically
- workspace:new-tab -- Open a new empty tab
- workspace:copy-path -- Copy the active file's vault-relative path to clipboard
- workspace:copy-url -- Copy an obsidian:// URL for the active file
- workspace:edit-file-title -- Rename the active file inline
- workspace:toggle-pin -- Pin or unpin the active tab (pinned tabs stay open)

workspace:export-pdf is a native Obsidian command -- zero external dependencies, always available.
It renders the note exactly as Obsidian displays it (theme, CSS, plugins applied).
Note: Opens an export dialog. The user must confirm settings and save location.

Use workspace:export-pdf for quick PDF exports. For advanced conversion (custom LaTeX templates, bibliography, DOCX): use execute_recipe with Pandoc instead.
